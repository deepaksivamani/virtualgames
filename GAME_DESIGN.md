## 2️⃣ GAME CONCEPT SUMMARY
Rebus Royale is a fast-paced multiplayer web game where players compete to solve visual word puzzles (rebus puzzles). Players join a room using a unique code or create a new one. Once the game starts, a visual puzzle—using text position, size, orientation, and images—appears on screen. Players race to type the correct phrase into the chat. Points are awarded based on speed; the faster you solve it, the more points you get. The player with the most points after a set number of rounds is crowned the winner.

## 3️⃣ GAME OBJECTIVE
Decipher the visual clues to guess the hidden phrase before the time runs out and score more points than your opponents.

## 6️⃣ GAME FLOW LOGIC
1. **Lobby**: Players join. Host settings (Round time: 30s, Rounds: 5).
2. **Start**: Host starts game.
3. **Turn Loop**:
   - Server selects random puzzle.
   - Timer starts (e.g. 30s).
   - Players guess.
   - **Correct Guess**: Player gets points (100 * (TimeLeft/TotalTime)). Player name turns green in list. Chat shows "Player guessed the word!".
   - **Wrong Guess**: Chat shows the guess (unless strict mode where close guesses are masked).
4. **End of Round**: Answer revealed. Leaderboard shown for 5s.
5. **Game Over**: Final podium + Celebration. Back to Lobby.

## 7️⃣ GAME RULES
- Don't spam the chat.
- Don't share answers in external calls.
- First to guess gets the most points.
- Spelling counts!

## 8️⃣ SCORING SYSTEM
- **Base Score**: 100 points.
- **Time Factor**: Points = Floor(Base * (TimeLeft / RoundTime)).
- **Streak Bonus**: +10 points for 3 correct in a row.
- **First Bonus**: +50 points for being first in the round.

## 9️⃣ MULTIPLAYER ROOM SYSTEM
- **Room Code**: 4-letter random code (e.g., A7X2).
- **Limit**: 10 players max.
- **Spectator**: Join active game -> auto-spectate until next round or just watch.
- **Reconnect**: Allow rejoin with same name/session ID if within 1 min (optional MVP).

## 🔟 CHAT + GUESSING FILTER
- **Correct Filter**: If guess == answer, block message, show "Guessed proper! (+Pts)" to everyone.
- **Close Guess**: If Levenshtein distance < 2, show "You are close!".

## 1️⃣1️⃣ TIMER + ROUND MECHANICS
- Default 30s per puzzle.
- If everyone guesses, round ends early.
- Overtime? No, speed is key.

## 1️⃣2️⃣ USER INTERFACE LAYOUT
- **Web/Mobile**: Responsive.
- **Top**: Progress Bar (Round X/Y), Score of top players.
- **Center**: The Puzzle Canvas. Large, clear typography.
- **Bottom**: Chat/Guess Input.
- **Right (Desktop) / Drawer (Mobile)**: Leading Player List.
- **Style**: "Glassmorphism" - semi-transparent backgrounds, blurs, vibrant gradients (Purple/Blue/Pink).

## 1️⃣3️⃣ DATABASE STRUCTURE (Ephemeral/In-Memory for MVP or SQL)
- `Room`: { id, code, players: [], state, currentRound, config }
- `Player`: { id, name, score, avatar, socketId }
- `Message`: { player, text, type (chat/system) }

## 1️⃣4️⃣ API / BACKEND STRUCTURE
- **WebSockets** (Socket.io) are essential for this real-time speed.
- `connect`: Handshake.
- `join_room`: { name, roomCode }
- `submit_guess`: { guess }
- `game_event`: { type: 'new_round', data: puzzle }

## 1️⃣5️⃣ TECHNOLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) - Great for routing and UI.
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (CSS Modules) or Tailwind. *We will use Vanilla CSS for full custom control.*
- **Backend Service**: Custom Node.js server with Socket.io (Next.js custom server).
- **Deployment**: Vercel (requires serverless socket adaptors) or Railway/Render (better for stateful socket servers). *For this scratchpad, we run locally.*

## 1️⃣6️⃣ ANTI CHEAT PROTECTION
- Answers are **never** sent to the client until the round ends.
- Validation happens on server.
- Rate limit guesses (1 per 500ms).

## 1️⃣7️⃣ EXPANSION FEATURES
- User drawing mode (classic Skribbl).
- Daily rebus puzzle.
- Team mode.
